# tali

A simple UI addon that computes the relative value of an item based on your current spec and pre-calculated stat weights stored in the TaliTable.lua file. Calculate them with any dps SIM and then add then update this table to have a quick idea of which item is better. It'll tali it up quickly!

I wrote this back in 2015 or so and have kept it working since. I've never released it publicly till now. It's simple and works. Put all these files into a folder named "~Tali" in your world of warcraft add-on folder mine is something like this:

K:\Program Files (x86)\Battle.net\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\~Tali
